        <p class="fw-600">What’s in the box?</p>
        <p>The first thing you’ll need to do is unbox your Handy™. Here’s what you can find inside the packaging, and the purposes of each piece:</p>
        <ul class="pl-2">
          <li><strong>The Handy™</strong> Of course, you’ll find your handy new device inside the packaging - ready to make your fantasies a reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Power supply & the Power cable</strong> (socket for your country included) - There’s nothing more annoying than toys dying mid-play, so the Handy operates on a cable only. The motor and computer we’ve put inside make for powerful play.</li>
          <li><strong>TrueGrip sleeve</strong> - This technology makes your pleasure experience unforgettable. Oh! By the way, see that foam roll inside your sleeve? Do not throw it away. This actually makes the sleeve last for longer so store it in your sleeve after each usage and cleaning.</li>
          <li><strong>TrueGrip band</strong> - This band helps you connect the sleeve to the Handy and adjust the grip to your liking.</li>
          <li><strong>User booklet Manual</strong> - The Handy ™ is capable of a whole lot… so we do recommend you read this!</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-5 fw-600">Manual Mode</p>
        <p>By default the Handy operates in the Manual (Offline) mode. So every time you plug it in or restart it, it’s ready to go without any additional setting up.</p>

        <ul class="pl-2">
          <li>Synch your Handy™ amazing content provided by our partners! 4k, 8k VR and so much more!</li>
          <li>Control your Handy remotely from anywhere on the planet (it’s not space compatible just yet)</li>
          <li>Play the videos locally on your device</li>

        <p class="fw-600">For New Users</p>
        <p>Every straight-from-the-box device is running on Firmware 2. The first step you need to do to dive into the Handyverse is to set up the WiFi connection. Put simply, you need to show your Handy how to connect to a WiFi of your choice. Note that the Handy can remember only one WiFi network at a time, so if you want to connect to a different one than the one saved on your Handy, you’ll need to go through the WiFi Setup again.</p>

        <p>If it's not your first time using The Handy, but you updated your device to Firmware 3 and have some questions, this manual is for you. The WiFi Setup process is a bit different than before, so we’ve got you covered with an easy guide.</p>
