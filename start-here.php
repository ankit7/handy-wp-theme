        <p>First ever thing you’ll do is opening the box. What can you find inside and what purpose each piece has?</p>
        <ul class="pl-2">
          <li><strong>The Handy TM</strong> - well... of course.</li>
          <li><strong>Power supply & the Power cable</strong> (socket for your country included) - the Handy operates on a cable only, so the powerful motor and computer we’ve put inside can do it’s job and you don’t need to worry if the battery dies on you half way through ;)</li>
          <li><strong>TrueGrip sleeve</strong> - to make the experience unforgettable. Oh! By the way, see that foam roll inside your sleeve? Do not trow it away. Store it in your sleeve after each usage and cleaning, to make the sleeve last longer!</li>
          <li><strong>TrueGrip band</strong> - so you can connect the sleeve to the Handy and adjust the grip to your liking</li>
          <li><strong>User booklet Manual</strong> - we do recommend you read this one ;)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-5 fw-600">Manual Mode</p>
        <p>By default the Handy operates in the Manual (Offline) mode. So every time you plug it in or restart it, it’s ready to go. Without any additional setting up. Just like this.</p>

        <p>Every straight-from-the-box device is running on Firmware 2. The first step you need to do to dive into the Handyverse is to set up the WiFi connection. In easy words, you need to show your Handy how to connect to a WiFi of your choice. Note that the Handy can remember only one WiFi network at a time, so if you want to connect to a different one than the one saved on your Handy, you need to go through the WiFi Setup again.</p>
